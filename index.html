    <h1>CAUB - Exploit by Bypassi - Unblocked by Blobby-Boi</h1>
    <h1>This only works on chrome 85 or higher</h1>
    <hr />
    this method (originally found by Catakang#0987) will help you keep your
    chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates
    screwing you over using onc files, you can convince your chromebook that the
    wifi that you're connected to is pay-to-use (like a hotspot using data), and
    thus it will not check for updates

    <b>I cannot guarantee that this will work on every wifi</b>

    <hr />
    <b>to start:</b>

    - go to chrome://network#state (on your school chromebook of course; if this
    is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol) - scroll to the bottom of the page;
    you should see a list of "favorite" wifis that you've connected to in the
    past - click the + sign next to the wifi name of each network that you
    commonly connect your chromebook to

    <b
      >the more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come
      from the "favorites" section</b
    >

    - use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state
    page - go back to this page (caub.glitch.me) - paste the copied text into
    the textbox below - press the "generate onc" button below the textbox

    <hr />
    <input placeholder="read instructions!" />

    <button onclick="gen()"><b>generate and download onc file</b></button>

    <b
      >the input stuff here is new and a little hacky, if it doesn't seem to
      work, try the <a href="/caub/old.html">old version</a></b
    >
    <hr />
    - once you have downloaded the file, go to chrome://network#general - click
    on the "import onc" button - import the newly downloaded file

    <b
      >your chromebook will no longer automatically update (as long as you are
      on a wifi that you used caub on) be careful not to stay on a wifi for too
      long without using caub on it</b
    >

    <hr />
    <b>bonus:</b>

    if you did caub on a school wifi that is forced by policy, you may be able
    to view its password by doing the steps below: - go to
    chrome://sync-internals on the chromebook - click "trigger getupdates"; the
    number of synced wifi configurations should go up - follow the steps at the
    <a href="https://sipe.glitch.me">sync internals password extractor</a> page
    you may also be able to change the dns of the wifi from settings, but don't
    expect it to connect
